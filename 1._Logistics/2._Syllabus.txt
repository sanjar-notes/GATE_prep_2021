====== 2. Syllabus ======
Created Monday 11 January 2021

I don't have much time, so I'll study as fast as possible.
Work Mode: Learn, compress the least and spit in the exam.
Don't(s)

=== Things to keep in mind ===
- No need to go into unnecessary depths.
- Make abstractions for undertstanding concepts as fast as possible.
- Using abstraction blocks, error are don't care.
- Study only what you're comfortable with.

=== Qualities to develop ===
* Fast solving ability, bring back JEE
* 80% emotionality.
* Notes are not important, link references.
* Take tests online.
* Solve old questions.
--------------------
List of subjects based on weightage(both frequency and marks), difficulty and time taken to learn. Points out of 10.
What to study first, the one with the least eval function.
* It should be easy and have more weightage.

Things to do:
* Look at papers and find distribution of marks.
* Check contextual data by skimming through the question
* Decide what to study.

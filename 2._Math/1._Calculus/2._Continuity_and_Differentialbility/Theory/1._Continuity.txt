====== 1. Continuity ======
Created Monday 18 January 2021

=== Continuity ===
* Intuitive definition - A function is said to be continuous if it can be drawn without lifting the pen.
* Technical definition - A function ''f'' is said to be continuous at ''a'', if the limit exists at ''a'' and is equal to ''f(a)''.
i.e LHL = RHL = value at point
aka lim_{x → a} f(x) = f(a)
* A function is said to be continuous(without mentioning a point) when it is continuous for all points in its domain.
* Discontinuous - Not continuous.
* Note that if ''f(a)'' exists but the limit does not, the function is still discontinuous.

=== Reasons for discontinuity ===
1. Limit does not exist
2. Value does not exist
3. Limit and value are not equal.

=== Some continuous functions ===
1. All Polynomials
2. Exponential
3. Logarithmic
4. Trigonometric(sin, cos, tan except at (2k+1)π/2) - same for reciprocals.

=== Theorems on continuity ===
* If ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous, then ''f±g'', ''f*g'', ''f/g(g≠0)'' are also continuous at ''a''.
* If one or both are discontinuous, then the function may still be continuous.

=== For selective domain ===
* If the domain is chopped at one end(i.e open interval), then we can ignore the limit at that outer end, i.e we have to evaluate value and a single limit(either RHL or LHL). Definition of continuity is relaxed.
* Single point continuity -  a function may be continuous at only one point, e.g the Dirichlet function and some its variations.

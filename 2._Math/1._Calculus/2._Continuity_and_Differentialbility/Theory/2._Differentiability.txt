====== 2. Differentiability ======
Created Monday 18 January 2021

=== Derivative ===
* The derivatives refers to the rate of change of a function with its independent variable(s).
* Geometrically it is the slope of the curve at a given point.
* Formally, derivatives are defined as a limit of the ratio of change of output and input.

=== Differentiability ===
* A function is said to be 'differentiable' at a point if the derivative exists at that point.
* A function is said to be 'differentiable'(without referring to a point), if the derivative exists for all points in its domain.
* Intuitively, a function is said to be differentiable if it can be drawn in a single stroke and without sharp vertices.
Note: Derivability and differentiability are the same.

=== Continuity vs differentiability ===
* Differentiability requires continuity.
* A function that is continuous may not be differentiable. e.g a continuous function with sharp point(s). Worst case example - Weierstrass function(continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere).
In short ''differentiability → continuity''.

=== Theorems on differentiability ===
* If ''f'' and ''g'' are differentiable at ''a'', then ''f±g'', ''f*g'', ''f/g(g'(a)≠0)'' are also differentiable at ''a''.
* If one or both are differentiable, then the function may still be differentiable.

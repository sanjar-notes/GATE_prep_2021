====== 3. Maxima and Minima ======
Created Monday 18 January 2021

=== Monotonicity ===
**Jargon**
	* An function is said to be monotonic over an interval [a, b] if sign of the derivative in the interval remains the same.
	* In other words, the function either increases or decreases or stays the same throughout the interval.
	* A function is called monotonous(without mentioning an interval) if it is monotonous throughout the domain.
* If a monotonic function is invertible, then it has to be either increasing or decreasing.
* If ''f'' is monotonic over [a, b], then ''f(a)'' and ''f(b)'' are optimal values.
* Monotonicity is a requirement when simplifying inequalities

=== Finding optima ===
Algorithm:
1. Find derivative and set it to zero.
2. Solve the equation for roots.
3. Find the second derivative and check it's value by setting the roots, if:
	a. f'' is +ve, then the root is an minima. Tip of the Happy face.
	b. f'' is -ve, then the root is a maxima. Tip of the Sad face.
	c. f'' is zero, test fails, can't say whether optima. May or may not be.
4. If the f' or f'' does not exist for a point, then we have to check it's value manually, i.e by inspection with other optima

=== Local vs Global optima ===
* All optima found using the algorithm are local optima, i.e there may be other optimums that are better.
* To declare a local optimum as the global optimum, there are two methods:
	a. Check every optima
		OR
	b. Prove that the function is monotonic

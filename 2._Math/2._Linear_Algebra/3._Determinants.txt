====== 3. Determinants ======
Created Friday 22 January 2021

This is a number, which is defined only for square matrices.

=== Determinant ===
Determinant of a 2x2 matrix {{./equation.png?type=equation}} is (ad-bc).

=== Minor ===
M_{ij} represents the determinant of the submatrix formed when ith row and jth column are deleted

=== Cofactor ===
Takes into account position of the element.
{{./pasted_image.png?height=200}}
C_{ij} = (-1)^{i+j }M_{ij}

=== Determinant of higher matrices(>2) ===
|A| = Sum of the product of elements and their corresponding cofactors, of any row or column.

=== Singular Matrix ===
A Matrix with the determinant of zero.

=== Properties of determinants ===
1. Sign of the determinant changes if any two rows or two columns are interchanged.
2. |A^{T}| = |A|
3. |AB| = |A|*|B| ...generalizable
4. |kA| = k^{n}|A|, where n = order
5. Determinant is zero if:
	a. Two rows are equal
	b. Two columns are equal
	c. All elements of a row or column are zero
6. Let A be a square matrix such that each element of a row or column of A is expressed as the sum of two or more terms. Then |A| can be expressed as the sum of the determinants of two or more matrices of the same order.

=== Elementary Tranformations on a matrix ===
There are 3:
1. Interchanging any two rows(or columns).
2. Multiply a row/column by a scalar.
3. row1 = k1*row1 + k2*row2. Can be done for column too.

Why only these: These don't change the determinant predictively, except that they never change the determinant value between 0 and non-zero.

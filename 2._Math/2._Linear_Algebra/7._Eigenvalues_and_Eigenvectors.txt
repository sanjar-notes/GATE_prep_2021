====== 7. Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors ======
Created Saturday 23 January 2021

This stuff is defined only for square matrices.

=== Revisiting matrix and vector multiplication ===
When a vector is multiplied(pre) by a matrix, the resulting vector can have two changes:
1. It is scaled(length changes)
2. It is rotated

* It is not necessary that both changes occur together always.

=== Eigen Vectors ===
Think of multiplying a set of vectors by a matrix. The resulting set of vector are likely to rotate and/or scale.

But there may be some vectors which don't get rotated.
* A vector that doesn't rotate is called **eigen vector**.
* The scale factor of an eigen vector is called its **eigen value**.

Note:
* The origin doesn't count as an eigen vector
* Eigen vectors may not exist at all. In this case, standard rules produce complex eigen vectors and eigen values. These eigen vectors are still rotated.
* Eigen vectors are associated with the matrix.

=== Properties of Eigen stuff ===
1. |A| = Π(λ)
2. tr(A) = Σ(λ)
3. Eigen values of related matrices:
	* kA = kλ
	* A^{k} = λ^{k}, including the inverse. Can be used to calculate adj(A)'s eigen too.
	* A^{T} = same as A
4. Maximum number of distinct eigenvalues is n
5. Eigen(AB) = Eigen(BA), assuming AB and BA are computable
6. For a triangular matrix, diagnonal elements ⇒ Eigen values

=== Finding Eigen Stuff ===
**Eigen Values**
* Solutions of the characteristic eqn, |A-λI| = 0 ⇒ Eigen Values
* Use tr(A) = Σ(λ) and |A| = Π(λ) for help.

**Eigen Vectors**
* Subsitute values into (A-λI)v = 0, keeping v as [x1 x2 x3]
* Compare and find the value of x1, x2 and x3 in terms of a parameter.
* Repeat for each eigen value.

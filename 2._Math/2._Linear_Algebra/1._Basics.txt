=== What are matrices ===
* Matrices are a way of representing data.
* Matrix representation facilitates automation.
* They can be scaled and can work on huge amounts of data.

=== Jargon ===
* Order → m x n ⇒ m rows and n columns.
* a_{ij }→ Element in the ith row and jth column
* Trace of a matrix - sum of elements of the principle diagonal

=== Equality of matrices ===
* Order is the same. i.e a1 = a2 and b1 = b2
* Corresponding elements are equal

=== Operations on matrices ===
1. Addition/Subtraction of two matrices
	* Order should be equal
	* Add all corresponding elements.
2. Multiplication(by scalar)
	* Multiply all elements by the scalar
3. Multiplication of two matrices
	* Order have to be in the form: a x b and b x c
	* Resulting matrix will have order a x c
	* Multiplication - Each row(in A) is multiplied by each column(in B) and the a_{ij} is set as the sum of the products.
	* Operations required - n^{3} for simple multiplication, but n^{2.7} has been achieved(strassens multiplication)
	* Meaning: Subsitution of values as into a set of linear equations. Order coherence is important because number of values = number of variables must hold.
	* A*B = B*A is **not true** in general, even for square matrices.
	* There are two types of multiplication - pre and post.
4. Transpose of a matrix - Rows and columns are interchanged.
	* Applicable for all matrices.
	* (A^{T})^{T} = A	 ...Double negation
	* (A+B)^{T} = A^{T}+B^{T	}... Generalization holds. Matrices must be addible.
	* (AB)^{T} = B^{T}A^{T}	... generalization holds, matrices must be multiplicatible.
	* (kA)^{T} = k * A^{T}
5. Complex Conjugation - all elements are replaced with their complex conjugates.

All operations here are associative(change groups) and distributive(combinable). But only addition is commutative.

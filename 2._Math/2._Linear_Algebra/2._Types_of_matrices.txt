====== 2. Types of matrices ======
Created Friday 22 January 2021

=== Basic Types ===
* Row matrix - has only one row
* Column matrix - has only one column
* Square matrix - number of rows = number of columns.
* Diagonal matrix - A **square** matrix where all elements except the **principle diagonal** are zero. i.e a_{ij} = 0 if i≠j ∀ valid i and j
* Identity matrix, a **square** diagonal matrix where all elements are 1.
* Scalar Matrix - A matrix of the form λI, where I is the identity matrix.
* Null matrix - all elements are zero.
* Upper triangular matrix - all elements below the diagonal are zero. Similar for lower traingular. Upper - non-upper is zero.

=== Special types ===
1. Nilpotent - a matrix A, such that A^{n} = 0 for some positive integer n. n is called the index of A in this case.
2. Idempotent(Square) → A^{2} = A
3. Involutory → A^{2} = I
4. Orthogonal → A matrix is called orthogonal if A * A^{T} = I
5. Symmetrical → A = A^{T}
6. Skew-symmetrical → A = -A^{T}. All diagonal elements are zero.
7. Hermitian → A = A^{c}. All diagonal elements are real.
8. Skew Hermitian → A = - A^{c}. All diagonal elements are purely imaginary.

Note: Nilpotent, symmetrical and skew-symmetrical have to be square matrices.

====== 4. Rank of a matrix ======
Created Friday 22 January 2021

Rank of a matrix - Number of linearly independent columns or rows(Both are equal).
It is defined for both square and non-square matrices.

=== Echelon form ===
* Elementary tranformations are applied in order to make all rows zeros(as much as possible).
* Then they(rows) are sorted - most non zero comes on top.
* Echelon form is always reachable.

=== How to find rank ===
* Reduce matrix to echoleon form.
* Rank = on zero rows

=== Properties of rank ===
1. Rank of a matrix is unique, because echelon is unique.
2. Rank of null matrix = 0
3. Every matrix has a rank
4. rank(A) ≤ min(m, n)
5. If A is a non-singular sqaure matrix → rank(A) = n
6. rank(I_{n}) = n ... follows from 5
7. If A and B are non-zero column and row matrices, then rank(AB) = 1
8. rank(A) = rank(A^{T}), because row or column doesn't matter in echelon form.
9. Rank stays the same upon multiplication by a non-singular matrix.
10. rank(AB) ≤	min(rank(A), rank(B)) - always smaller/equal to the smaller.
11. Elementary tranformation don't change the rank.

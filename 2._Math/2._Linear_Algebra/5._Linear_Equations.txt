====== 5. Linear Equations ======
Created Friday 22 January 2021

=== Jargon ===
* Inconsistent - has no solution
* Consistent - has atleast one solution
* Indeterminate - has more than one solution.
* General form ⇒ ax+by+cz = d
* Homogeneous system - All RHS(d) terms are 0.

=== Representing linear equations ===
AX= B is the general form.
A = matrix of coefficients
X = vector(column matrix) of variables
B = RHS terms

=== Ways to solve Linear eqns ===
1. Substitution
	* Isolate a variable in terms of others in the first eqns.
	* Substitute the variable in all eqns.
	* We have reduced a variable by using an eqns. 
	* Repeat the process until there's a single variable left.
	* Compute the other variables
2. Gaussian Elimination
	* Reduce the augmented matrix to reduced echelon form. i.e each row has a 1 and each column having a 1 has all other entries zero.
	* The solution is obvious now.
3. Cramer's rule - generalizable to any dimension
	* x = Δ_{1}/Δ
	* y = Δ_{2}/Δ
	* z = Δ_{3}/Δ

=== Linear Combination ===
A linear combination of a vector is the sum of the scaled vectors, where not all scales are zero.
In other words,
LC(a, b, c, d) = k1*a + k2*b + k3*c  + k4*d, such that not all k1, k2, k3 and k4 are zero.

=== Independent and Dependednt Vectors ===
This is defined for a set of vectors.
* Dependent - If there exists atleast one vector that can be expressed as a linear combination of others. 
* Independent - If no vector can be written as a LC of the others, i.e all are different.

**How to check dependence**
* If Δ = 0 → dependent
* If Δ ≠ 0 → independent

=== Nature of solutions ===
There are only 3 possibilities - No solution, one solution or ∞ number of solutions.
1. Homogeneous eqns - Origin is always a solution.
	If Δ = 0 → ∞ many solutions
	else → One solution(i.e origin)
2. Non-homgeneous eqns
	If Δ ≠ 0 → One solution(unique)
	else(as RHS≠0, we have to use ranks now)
		* If rank = n → No solution ...different RHS for same LHS
		* If rank ≠ n → Infinitely many solutions (i.e data insufficiency - eqns are less than unknowns)
**MAID - Covers everything**
* Use cramers's rule when Δ ≠ 0
* For homogeneous, know that origin is always the solution. So if Δ = 0, then there are ∞ solutions
* For non homogeneous and Δ = 0, keep in mind that we have to deal with RHS too. So we need to use rank(i.e echelon form).

====== 1. Sets ======
Created Sunday 24 January 2021

Set - A well defined collection of distinct objects is called a set.

=== Set representation ===
1. Roster(or tabular form) - comma separated values(objects) surrounded by braces({}). e.g {1, 2, 3}
2. Set-builders form - A rule which can be used to enumerate all objects of the set.
	e.g { x | x ∈ Ζ and 1< x < 10 } = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}

=== Types of Sets ===
1. Empty set(or null set) - A set having zero elements
2. Singleton set - A set having just one element
3. Pair set - A set having two elements
4. Finite set - A set with finite cardinality
5. Infinite set - A set with infinite cardinality

=== Terms ===
0. Elements - Another word for object residing within a set
1. Cardinality - total number of elements in a set.
2. Equal sets - two sets A and B are equal if:
	* Have the same cardinality
	* Each member of A is also a member of B and vice versa.
3. Subset - A is said to be a subset of B if each element of A also belongs to B. The converse need not be true. Notation A ⊂ B
4. Proper subset - A is said to be a proper subset of B if A is a subset of B but not equal to B. In other words, B has elements that are absent from A.
5. Universal Set - The set of all possible elements for a given topic. This is decided arbitrarily.
6. Power Set - A set containing all possible subsets of a given set. |P(A)| = 2^{|A|}

=== Operation On Sets ===
1. Union of sets(A ∪ B) - The set which contains all the elements of A and B
2. Intersection(A ∩ B) - The set that contains elements that are present in both A and B
3. Difference(A - B)  - The set having all elements of A that are not in B.
4. Symmetric Difference(A ⊕ B) - The set having elements that are either in A or in B, but not both.
5. Complement of a set(A') - The set containing all elements of the universal set that are not in A
=== Laws and Theorems ===
1. Idempotent - A ∪ A = A, A ∩ A = A
2. Identity - A ∪ φ = A, A ∩ U = A
3. Commutative - All except difference are commutative.
4. Associative - A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C, A ∩ (B ∩ C) = (A ∩ B) ∩ C
5. Distribution laws - A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C)
6. De-morgan's laws
7. (A ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ B ′, (A ∩ B)′ = A′ ∪ B ′
=== Venn Diagrams ===
They are way to represent sets graphically.

=== Applications of Sets ===
* |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|
* |A'| = |U| - |A|
* |A - B| = |A| - |A ∩ B|
* |A ⊕ B| = |A| + |B| - 2*|A ∩ B|
* |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |B ∩ C| - |C ∩ A| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|

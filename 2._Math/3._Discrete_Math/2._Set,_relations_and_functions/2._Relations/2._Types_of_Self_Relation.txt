====== 2. Types of Self Relation ======
Created Sunday 24 January 2021

"Relation on A" doesn't seem to make sense, where's the other one?
This terminology is actually used for A → A relations.

=== Types of self relations ===
**Reflexive**
* Reflexive - If the relation contains **all** tuples (x, x) ∀ x ∈ A. Relexive relations can have other elements too.
* Anti-reflexive(irreflexive) - If the relation has **no** all (x, x) ∀ x ∈ A.
* Not reflexive - neither reflexive nor anti-reflexive.

**Symmetric**
* Symmetric - xRy → yRx, where x ∈ A, y ∈ A 
* Anti-symmetric - If the relation has **no** tuples (x, y) ∀x ∀y ∈ A.
* Asymmetric(aka not symmetric) - If a relation is not symmetric, there may be some or no (x, y) ∀x ∀y ∈ A.

**Transitive**
* Transitive - Presence of (x, y) and (y, z) → Presence of (x, z) ∀x ∀y ∀z ∈ A
* Transitive is condition based.

**Equivalence Relation**
R is said to be an 'equivalence relation on A' if it:
* Reflexive
* Symmetric
* Transitive

**Parial Order(symmetry banned Equivalence)**
R is said to be a partial order on A if:
* R is reflexive
* R is anti-symmetric
* R is transitive
MAID: A commutative-like relation, there's no need for (y, x) if (x, y) is present.

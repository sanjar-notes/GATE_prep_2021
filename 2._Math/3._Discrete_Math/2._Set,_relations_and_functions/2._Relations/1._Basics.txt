=== Cartesion Product of Sets ===
**Definition**
A cartesian product of two sets is the **set** of all possible ordered 2-tuples(pairs), where for each pair first one belongs to the first set and the second one to second.

Mathematically,
A x B = {(x, y) | x ∈ A and y ∈ B}
* If we multiply three sets, then the result is a 3-tuple, with 1st, 2nd and 3rd element(of a pair) belonging to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd set.
* From now on, I'll be talking about binary relations only because all the concepts are generalizable for n-ary relations.
* Relations are not commutative.

=== Relation ===
Definition - It is a subset of the cartesian product of the sets involved in the relation.
R ⊆ A x B
* Typically, relations are binary.
* Think of it as a mapping between elements of A and B.

=== Types of Relations ===
1. Inverse of a relation - R^{-1} is set to be inverse of R if it contains all tuples in reverse(i.e reversed tuples of R).
	R = {(1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 0)} then
	R^{-1} = {(0, 1), (3, 1), (4, 1), (0, 2)}
2. Identity relation - A relation where all elements of each tuple are equal.
3. Universal Relation - If R = A x B, then R is said to be the universal relation on A to B
4. Void relation - A relation with no elements.

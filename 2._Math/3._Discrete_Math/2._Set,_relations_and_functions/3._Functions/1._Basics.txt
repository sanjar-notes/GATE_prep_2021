We'll be speaking of binary functions here. But they can be n-ary too.

**Function**
A relation R from A to be is said to be a function if:
1. For each (x, y) ∈ f →  x ∈ A and y ∈ B 	...Seperation
2. For each (x, y1) ∈ f and (x, y2) ∈ f, y1 = y2. i.e for each 'pre-image' in A, there should be a only one image in B.

* Just like a relation, a function is also a subset of the cartesian product.
* A just like a relation, it is a set of ordered tuples.

MAID - Functions are just disciplined mappings.

**Notation of function**
f:A→B
This [[https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3947561/741802|notation]] describes three things:
1. ''f'' - name of the function
2. ''A'' - Domain of the function
3. ''B'' - Codomain of the function. This is not always equal to range.

=== Jargon ===
* pre-image - aka input
* image - aka output
* Domain - Set of values which appear in the first part of the tuple. These are basically 'allowed' input values. Generally, this is the whole set A itself. **Fixed**.
* Range - The set of output values. **Fixed**.
* Codomain - Superset of the range. It is technically arbitrary - but is mostly the well known number sets Z, N, R, or C.

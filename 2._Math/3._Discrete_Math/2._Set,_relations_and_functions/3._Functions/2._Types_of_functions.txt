====== 2. Types of functions ======
Created Sunday 24 January 2021

1. **One-one(aka injective)** - If each pre-image has a unique image.
	* |Domain| = |Range|
2. **Onto(aka surjective)** - If range covers the whole codomain.
	* |Range| = |Codomain|
3. **Many-one function** - A function where atleast two inputs map to the same output. In other words, a function that is not one-one.
	* |Domain| > |Range|
4. **Into function** - A function that is not onto. i.e Not all points in the codomain are covered.
	* |Range| < |Codomain|
5. **Constant function** - If the all pre-images(inputs) map to the same image(output).
	* |Range| = 1
6. **Identity function** - If output is the same as input for all inputs.
	* f(x) = x
	* They are both one-one and onto

Maid: All types are just opposites of one-one and onto.

=== Special types of function ===
1. Bijective Function - A function that is both one-one and onto
2. Inverse Function - f^{-1} is said to be the inverse of f if for every value in Range f^{-1} returns the input value in the Domain.
	* Inverse exists only for bijective functions
	* Inverse is unique.

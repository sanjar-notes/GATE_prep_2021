====== 3. Composition Of functions ======
Created Sunday 24 January 2021

**Definiton**
Let f:A → B and g:B → C, then the composite function of ''g'' and ''f'' mapping A to C is denoted by ''g''o''f''.
* gof(x) = g(f(x))
* gof is a short form.

Note: 

* gof exists only if Domain(f) = Range(g)
* If f and g are bijective then gof is also bijective.
* We can chain functions to any length, given their domain and range are the same for each link.

====== 5. Generating Functions ======
Created Tuesday 26 January 2021

* It is a single variable expression that yields a value. It may infinite(i.e number of terms).
* Think of it as a vector of coefficients, i.e G(x) = a_{0}, a_{1} etc

=== Ordinary Generating function ===

=== Probability Generating function ===
If a_{n} is the probability distribution of random variable x, then G(x) is called probability generating function.

=== Exponential Generating function ===
Same as exponential series but with a_{i} multiplied to each term.

=== Possion Generating function ===
EG multiplied by e^{-x}

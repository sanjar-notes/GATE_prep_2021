====== 6. Recurrence Relations ======
Created Tuesday 26 January 2021

=== Logistic Map ===
The most basic form of recurrence relation - i.e definition for the nth term.

* This needs to be solved to give a closed form solution.

=== Solution of Recurrence Relations ===
1. By inspection, i.e guess and prove.
2. By Recursive-tree method - draw a tree and work at each level.
3. Master Theorem

**MAID**
* Skeleton - a, b, c, k. c doesn't matter.
* Base is b everywhere
* Power in answer - max(k, log_{b}(a)) - whichever is larger
* You get an extra log_{b}(**n**) only in the equality.

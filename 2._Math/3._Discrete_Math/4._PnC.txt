=== FPA(Fundamental Principle of Addition) ===
If there are two tasks that can be performed independently in m and n ways respectively. Then there are m+n possible ways to do one job.
* This can be generalized
e.g 4 chocolates and 5 biscuits, we have to eat one - There are 9 ways.

=== FPM(Fundamental Principle of Multiplication) ===
If there are two tasks that needs to be performed in order, and that they can be done in m and n ways, respectively. Then there are m*n ways to do the jobs.
* This can be generalized
e.g 4 burgers and 10 types of drinks, a meal(i.e burger + drink) can be made in 40 ways.

=== Permutations ===
Permutation - An arrangement.
* Think of it as taking photos - the camera or the photo is never flipped.
* This is similar to an ordered list(array).
**Formula - Number of permutations of r things(taken from a set of r distinct things)**
* ^{n}P_{r} = (n!)/(n-r)!
* If everything is taken, then n!
* When some objects are not distinct, some permutations may be repeated. So we need to divide by ^{a}P_{a'} for each distinct. Simpler cases:
	* All - {{./pasted_image.png}}

=== Combinations ===
Combination - A selection, order does not matter
Selecting r things from n things

* Similar to a set - order does not matter.
**Properties of combination**

* Combinations can be split

* Cancellability

**Combination Trivia**
* Greatest combination term
	* For even - middle one → ^{n}C_{n/2}
	* For odd - middle two → {{./pasted_image006.png}}

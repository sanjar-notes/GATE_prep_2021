====== 7. Paths ======
Created Wednesday 27 January 2021

=== Path ===
* Path - an ordered list of edges. Informal - walk
* Simple path - a path without repetition of any edges(except if they begin and end at the same vertex). Informal - trail
* Circuit - A path which begins and ends at the same vertex. Informal - closed walk, closed path
* Simple circuit - a path without repetition of vertices.

MAID:
* Path is concerned only about edges
* Circuit is concerned only about vertices.

Fun examples of paths
* Collaboration graphs - Erdos number(shortest path of the person for Paul Erdos - for mathematicians mostly), Bacon number(shortest path of collaboration with Kevin Bacon) in Hollywood.

=== Connectedness ===
* A graph is said to be connected if you can reach any vertex by staring from any other vertex. For directed graphs - you have to follow the edges.
* If degree of all vertices is nonzero, then an undirected graph is said to be "connected".

=== Strongly connected ===
A graph is said to be strongly connected if there's a path from vertex A to B and from B to A ∀ A, B ∈ V, A≠B.
* SCC - strongly connected component - a strongly connected subgraph

=== Cycle ===
A graph is said to have a cycle if it is possible to define atleast one path where the starting and ending vertex is the same. 
* Self loops are counted as a cycle.

=== Euler stuff(mAid: All E) ===
Euler circuit - A circuit containing all edges without repetition.
Euler path - A path containing all edges without repetition.
* Repetition - repetition of edges

Criteria for Euler stuff:
* Euler circuit exists ↔ All Degrees are even. Greedy algroithm does it.
* Euler path exists ↔ Two vertices have odd degree.
Note: Both(Epath and Ecircuit) cannot exist together.

Trivia
* mAid - we are concerned with vertices because the study originated from Konigsberg river crossing problem, which Euler solved in 1736.

=== Hamiltonian stuff(mAid: All V) ===
Hamiltonian path - A path containing all vertices without repetition.
Hamiltonian circuit - A path containing all vertices without repetition.
* Repetition - repetition of vertices

Criteria for hCircuit
* No necessary conditions are known. 
* Disqualifiers
 - Hamiltonian circuit cannot exist if any vertex of degree 1 is present.
* A Hamilton circuit cannot contain a smaller circuit within it.
* Although some theorems do give sufficient Hamiltonian circuits. How(?) → It is quite simple, if a graph is dense then there are more chances that a hamiltonian circuit exists. So if a graph is dense beyond a threshold, then we can even say for sure that the hCircuit exists for sure.
	a. **Dirac's Theorem** - If every vertex has a minimum of n/2 as degree, then a hamiltonian circuit exists.
	b. **Orge's Theorem** - If for any two vertices u, v, deg(u)+deg(v) ≥ n, then a hamiltonian circuit exists.
	* n = |V| here and n≥3 should hold. This is a basic criteria for any kind of circuit, not specific to these theorems or Hamiltonian circuits.
	* These are sufficient conditions: A hamiltonian circuit may exist even if these theorems are not satisied.
	* Yes, Dirac is actually the stepson of PAM Dirac.
Trivia
* mAid - we are concerned with vertices because the study originated from Hamilton's Around the world puzzle.


=== TSP ===
Statement → Find a Hamilton circuit in a complete graph such that the total weight of its edges is as small as possible.

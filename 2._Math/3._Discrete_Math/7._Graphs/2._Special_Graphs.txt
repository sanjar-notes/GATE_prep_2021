====== 2. Special Graphs ======
Created Tuesday 26 January 2021

There are 4 kinds of special graphs:
1. Complete graph(K_{n}) - A graph with n vertices where each edge is connected to every other edge.
	* n≥1
	* Noncomplete - word for not complete
	* |E| = ^{|v|}C_{2} = v*(v-1)/2

2. Cycle graph(C_{n}) - A graph where all edges combine to form an edge.
	* n ≥ 3
	* |E| = n
3. Wheel(W_{n}) - A graph like a wheel
	* The axle node is not counted
	* n ≥ 3
	* |E| = 2*v

4. n-Cube(Q_{n}) - An n dimensional hypercube is a graph containing:
	* Nodes - binary number ≤ n
	* Edge - connects nodes that differ by 1
	* Graph may not be planar.

=== More graphs ===
* Regular graph - A graph where every vertex has the same degree.
* Tree graph(just tree) - a connected acyclic(without a cycle) graph

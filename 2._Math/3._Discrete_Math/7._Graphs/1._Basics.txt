A graph is a collection of two sets:
* Vertices(V)
* Edges(E) - E is a set of pairs, pairs may or may not be ordered.

Note: V and E may be infinite

=== Why study graphs ===
They are used to model a large variety of phenomena.
Terminlogies:
1. Simple graph - An undirected graph with no self-loops and no multiedges.
2. Multigraph - An undirected graphs with potential multiedges.
3. Pseudograph - A multigraph with potential self-loops.
4. Digraph - A directed graph.
5. Simple directed graph - A simple graph with directed edges.
6. Mixed graph - A graph having both directed and undirected edges.

=== Degree ===
This is a property of a node(vertex):
* Undirected - Sum of all edges connected to a graph. Loop contributes 2.
* Directed - There are two degrees:
	* In-degree - Number of edges coming entering the node.
	* Out-degree - Number of edges leaving the node.

=== Jargon ===
* Isolated - Degree is zero
* Pendant - Degree is one
* Incident with u and v - joining(or connecting) u and v
* Neigbourhood - Number of nodes directly connected to the node. For directed, number of nodes connecting host to them directly.

=== Handshaking Lemma ===
* For an undirected graph
	**Sum of degrees(of all nodes) = 2 |E|**
Corrollary:
Number of odd-degree nodes in an undirected graph are even.
* For a directed graph
	Sum(indegree) = Sum(outdegree) = |E|

=== Operations on Graphs ===
1. Union Of Graphs
	Two graphs G_{1} and G_{2} can be combined to get a graph with vertices V_{1} U V_{2} and edges E_{1} U E_{2}. 
2. Intersection of graphs - only common stuff is kept, all edges are retained in a conjunction fashion, i.e V_{1} ∩ V_{2} and edges E_{1} ∩ E_{2}. 
3. Complement - Only edges change in this graph. E^{'} = U - E, where U is the edge set of a complete graph version of the given graph.
4. Product - similar to cartesian product. The product is not actually a generator of sorts: two points from V_{1} x V_{2}, say u(u_{1}, u_{2}) and v(v_{1}, v_{2}) are adjacent if any of the following holds:
	* u_{1} = v_{1} and u_{2} and v_{2} are adjacent
	* u_{2} = v_{2} and u_{1} and v_{1} are adjacent
5. Composition - The composition of G_{1} and G_{2}, G_{1}[G_{2}] is the graph where two points from V_{1} x V_{2}, say u(u_{1}, u_{2}) and v(v_{1}, v_{2}) are adjacent if any of the following holds:
	* u_{1} is adjacent to v_{1}
	* u_{1} = v_{1} and u_{2} is adjacent to v_{2}

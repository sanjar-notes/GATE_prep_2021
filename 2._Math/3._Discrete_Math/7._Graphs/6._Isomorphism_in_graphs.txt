====== 6. Isomorphism in graphs ======
Created Wednesday 27 January 2021

Two graphs are said to be isomorphic if they are the same when the identity of their vertices are ignored.
Neccessary and sufficient criteria for two isomorphic graphs:
* Existence of a function //f// such that f is one-one and onto considering G_{1} as domain and G_{2} as range. i.e if a and b are adjacent in G_{1} then f(a) and f(b) are adjacent in G_{2}
Note: 
* The function //f// is called the isomorphism.
* Onto needs |V_{1}| = |V_{2}| and one-one needs |E_{1}| = |E_{2}| and that they are correlated properly.

=== Proving that two graphs are ''not'' isomporhic ===
Find the invariants of G_{1}, show that atleast one of them does not hold in G_{2}.
* Note: Even if all invariants hold, it is not sufficient to conclude that the graphs are isomporhic.
	* A counter-example to validate this → There's a graph with degree ≥	0 for all nodes. Now we can easily create non-isomorphic examples where the |V|, |E| and this invariant holds → These invariants are not enough.
* There are no useful sets of invariants currently known that can be used to determine whether simple graphs are isomorphic.
* Exponential time algorithms exist however. Hint: They permut the graph matrices to see if they match.

Working with isomorphs is a very interesting and signifcant issue that comes up in:
1. Chemistry - isomers and molecular formulas
2. IC industry - chips need to be verified as to whether they are the same as the vendor design
3. Computer Vision
4. Bioinformatics

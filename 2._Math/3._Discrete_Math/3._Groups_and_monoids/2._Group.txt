====== 2. Group ======
Created Monday 25 January 2021

* Group - A semigroup which has 2 additional features:
	a. presence of an identity
	b. Invertibility
* Abelian group - a commutative group.
* Order of group - cardinality of the group's set. Defined only for finite set.

* There are only 5 main operations we're concerned about in algebraic structures:
	1. Identity
	2. Invertibility
	3. Associativity
	4. Commutativity
	5. Totality

=== Some important theorems ===
1. Identity element in a group is unique.
2. Inverse of every element in a group is unique.
3. (x^{-1})^{-1} = x
4. (x*y)^{-1} = y^{-1 }* x^{-1}
5. It is cancellative.
6. Follows exponent laws.
	* x^{m} * x^{n} = x^{m+n}
	* (x^{m})^{n} = x^{mn}

=== Residue class ===
When a set is partitioned using the modulo operator(mod n), n sets are said to be formed.

====== 1. Semi-group ======
Created Monday 25 January 2021

=== Basics ===
* **Algebraic system** - A set having some operation(s) which acts on the set's elements.
* **Binary operation** - A relation S x S → S. Most binary operations are actually partial(i.e subset of S x S). It may not be a function.
* **Semi-group** - A set with an **associative** binary operation.
* **Monoid** - Semigroup with an identity element. e.g (R, + ,0) or (R, * , 1). i.e x*e = x

MAID - Semi group is the most basic form of an ADT

=== Invertibility ===
* Left Inverse - y such that y * x = I
* Right Inverse - y such that x * y = I
* Invertible - An element is called invertible if it is both left and right invertible.

=== Cancellability ===
* Left cancellative - If x*y=x*z → y = z, then the semigroup is left cancellative.
* Right cancellative - If y*x = z*x → y = z, then the semigroup is right cancellative
* A semigroup that is both left and right cancellative is called 'cancellative'

=== Some important theorems ===
1. Identity, if it exists, is unique.
2. If a semigroup is invertible → x*y is also invertible
	* In fact x*y = y^{-1} * x^{-1}

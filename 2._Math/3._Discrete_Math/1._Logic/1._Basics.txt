* Statement - A statement that is either false or true. i.e It cannot be both.
* NOT - this is a unary operation. It flips the value.

=== Universal Connectives ===
* AND(conjunction) - represented by . True if all statements are true.
* OR(disjunction) - represented by +. True if atleast one statement is true.
* NOT - unary for flipping 


All basic operations here are:
* Distributive
* Associative
* Commutative

=== More connectives ===
* Implication - a → b - equivalent to  ~A + B
* XOR - represented by - True if parity is odd ⇒ A.B'+A'.B
* Double implication - (a → b).(b → a) ≡ A.B + ~A.~B
* NAND - (A.B)'
* NOR - (A+B)'

=== Duality Law ===
A' is said to be the dual of A if we get A' when all AND and ORs are interchanged in A.

=== Logical Identitites ===
* Idempotent - A.A = A and A+A=A
* Identity - A+0 = A and A.1 = A
* Commutative - For both AND and OR
* Associative(or absortion) - A+(B+C) = (A+B)+C. Same for AND
* Distributive - A.(B+C) = A.B + A.C
* De-morgan's laws - (A+B)' = A'.B' and (AB)' = A'+B'
* Involution - (A')' = A
* A+1 = 1 and A.0 = 0

=== Some about implications ===
Given A → B
* Converse - B → A
* Inverse - ~A → ~B
* Contrapositive - ~B → ~A
Note: Contrapositive is the same as original.

=== Jargon ===
Tautology - Always True
Contradiction - Always False

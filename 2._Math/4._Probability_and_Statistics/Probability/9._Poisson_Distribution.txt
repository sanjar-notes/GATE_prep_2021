====== 9. Poisson Distribution ======
Created Sunday 31 January 2021

**Situation** - We have a random experiment where events are independent and binary in nature, labelled success or failure. Same as binomial.
**Difference from Binomial** - The experiment is discrete but infinite(number of trials very high).
**mAid:** 
	* poisoned binomial - asymptotic case, i.e n → ∞
	* The PDF is simple → e^{-λ} EG(x) where λ is the average rate of success over a long time.

=== Equations ===
* Assumptions for Poisson
	* n → ∞ (very large)
	* p → 0 (very small)
	* np = 1
* We use the expected value as a param, because it can be calculated empirically.
* PDF → f(X=r) = λ^{r}e^{-λ}/r!
* Mean = variance = λ

====== 1. Basics - Definition of Probability ======
Created Saturday 30 January 2021

=== Jargon ===
* Sample space - The set of all possible outcomes.
* Probability - a measure of likelihood for an event

=== Probability ===
There are three definitions:
1. For discrete stuff - (number of chosen events)/(Number of all possible events)
2. For continuous stuff - (magnitude of chosen event)/(magnitude of sample space)

=== Theories of Probability ===
There are 3 theories:
1. **A-priori** - Used for equally likely events which are finite. This is purely theoretical.
2. **Empirical(or statistical)** - Useful even if outcomes are not equally likely but finite. Experimental.
3. **Axiomatic** - Used for both not equally likely and for infinite. This is the one given by Kolmogorov.

=== Properties of Probability(Axiomatic Theory of Probability) ===
1. **Non-negativeness** - The probability of an event is a non-negative real number
2. **Unitarity** - ''ΣP(A''_{''i''}'') = 1''; sum of probabilities of all possible outcomes is 1
3. **Additivity** - P(∪A_{i}) = ΣP(A_{i}), where all A_{i} are disjoint sets.

Note: Negative, infinite and uncountable events are allowed for quasiprobabilistic distributions. **We'll not be dealing with them here.**

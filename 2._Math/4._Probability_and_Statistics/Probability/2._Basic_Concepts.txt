====== 2. Basic Concepts ======
Created Saturday 30 January 2021

=== Addition Theorem of Probability ===
''P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)''
* A special case: ''P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B)'', iff A and B are disjoint.
* The theorem is generalizable.
* Keyword: **OR/UNION**

=== Dependence of events ===
* **Mutually** **indepenent events** - Two events whose probability remains the same due occurence of the other event. This includes the order of occurrence of the events. Example - Flipping a fair coin for the first time vs flipping it the 7th time.
* **Dependent events** - Events are said to be dependent if the occurence of one causes a change in the probability of the other. Flipping a coin for the first time vs getting 2 heads in 4 tosses - we see that the two events are linked.

=== Conditional Probability ===
* This is a concept in probability used to deal with dependent events.
* P(A | B) is the "probability of event A given B has already occurred"
* ''P(A | B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B)''
* For independent events - P(A|B) is the same as P(A), and P(B|A) is the same as P(B).
* ''P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B)'' holds if and only if A and B are independent. This serves as a criteria for independence.

=== Multiplication Theorem of Probability ===
This follows from conditional probability.
* ''P(∩A''_{''i''}'') = ΠP(A''_{''i''}'')'' given all events are independent.
* This is probability when "Both A and B" occur, and is generalizable.
* Keyword: **AND/INTERSECTION** 

=== Complement event ===
This is the probability for "not A"
''P(A') = 1 - P(A)''

=== Algebra of Probabilities ===
* Complement, addition and multiplication theorems are used to calculate probabilities for events.
* All the set identities can be used directly i.e just enclose each compound term by ''P()''. Example: ''P(A - B) = P(A) - P(A ∩ B)'', because ''A - B = A - A ∩ B''

=== Compound Inequality ===
The following inequality always holds

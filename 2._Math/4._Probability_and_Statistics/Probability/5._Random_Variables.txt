====== 5. Random Variables ======
Created Saturday 30 January 2021

* Random variable is a tool used to map events to real numbers.

* They are chosen as per convenience.

=== Criteria for choosing RVs ===
* Mathematically, RVs should be functions with real numbers as range.
* Sample space is essentially the range of the RV.
* The chosen function must satisfy the 3 axioms of probability.

=== Why use RVs ===
* Quantifies the outcomes
* Equations are short and unambiguous. We don't need to write long English phrases, we can say P(X = 1) instead of P(tail occurs).

=== Types of RVs ===
There are two kinds of RVs:
1. **Discrete** RVs - The codomain is a set of discrete values, i.e integral or any other discrete object(even emojis can be used). e.g number of children per family, number of cars a person owns.
2. **Continuous** RVs - The codomain is a set of uncountably infinite values. Example - height of a person, amount of water a person drinks in a day.

Note: To decide whether to use continuous or discrete RVs, check if the output can be measured accurately indefinitely(at-least in theory): if this is true use continuous.

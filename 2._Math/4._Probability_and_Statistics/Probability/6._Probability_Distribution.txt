====== 6. Probability Distribution ======
Created Saturday 30 January 2021

=== Probability Distribution(or Density) Functions ===
These are functions which take an RV as input and output the probability of its occurrence.

DRV - Bar graphs or pie charts, whose values add to 1.

CRV - Continuous functions with unity as area(under the curve).

Note: 
* In case of CRVs, P(X=c) = 0: probability is defined only for an interval. i.e P(X=c1 to c2) = _{c1}âˆ«^{c2}P(X)dx is meaningful.
* RVs are chosen in such a way that they are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.

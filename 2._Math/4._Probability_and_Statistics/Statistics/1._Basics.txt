=== Central Tendency ===
We try to assign a representative value for the whole dataset.
Various measures of central tendency exists, viz:
1. Mean - 3 kinds are there
2. Median - Middle one in sorted order
3. Mode - highest frequency

=== Mean ===
There are three kinds of means:
1. Arithmetic Mean = Σx/N
2. Geometric Mean = (Πx)^{1/N}
3. Harmonic Mean = ((Σ1/x)/N)^{-1} = reciprocal of AM of reciprocals

Note: Relation between mean/median/mode: AM ≥ GM ≥ HM. Equality holds iff all terms are equal.

=== Jargon ===
Range = Max-Min = a distance
Mid Range = (Max+Min)/2 = a value

=== Measures Of Dispersion ===
We try to measure the deviation data points w.r.t the mean or otherwise.
There are 3 basic ways:
1. Variance(σ^{2}), dimension = data^{2}
2. Other moments

=== Relation of mean-median-mode for a moderately skewed distribution ===

* 3* Median = 2 * Mean + Mode
* All 3 are equal for a symmetrical distribution

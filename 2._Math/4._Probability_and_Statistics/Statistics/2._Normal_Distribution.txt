====== 2. Normal Distribution ======
Created Sunday 31 January 2021

* This also called a Gaussian Distribution.
* It is pretty common in various phenomena.

=== Assumptions ===
* Continuous RV
* Single maxima at X=mean
* Rate of PDF ∝ P(x) * x

=== Derivation of PDF ===
The assumptions are enough to derive the expression

=== Equations ===
* Expected value = μ
* Variance = σ^{2}

Note: This is just a coincidence, the definition of mean(expected value) and probability have nothing to do with the normal of distribution of the dataset.

Created Monday 01 February 2021

* Tree diagrams are the easiest way to solve these problems.
Draw the tree in stages(where each stage actually refers to all people in that generation):
* 1st stage → Grandparental
* 2nd stage → Parental
* 3rd stage → Yourself and equivalents
* 4th stage → Children
* 5th stage → Grandchildren

=== Tricks to solve blood-relation ===
* Encoding things properly makes it easily solvable
1. Proper nouns must start with capital
2. Where gender is important, make a bar on top of females
3. Put older people on the top of younger generation ones.
4. For spousal relation, use single implication(→), with male on the left(preferably).
5. To denote relation(if unknown or otherwise) use ... ellipsis.
6. When gender is not confirmed use a an enclosing box around the person.

====== 1. Cubes and Dices ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

=== Cube ===
Facts about a cube 😆️:
1. 8 corners
2. 6 faces
3. 12 edges
4. TSA = 6a^{2}
5. Volume = a^{3}
* F + V = E + 2 holds

* When dividing a cube into n cubes, caluclate the dimensions of the new cube w.r.t volume, because that is an invariant.

=== Die ===
Has a number from {1, ... 6} on each face, without repetition.
Symmetrical die → Sum of opposite faces is constant. It is 7
Asymmetrical → Sum of opposite faces is not constant

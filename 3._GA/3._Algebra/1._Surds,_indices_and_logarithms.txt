Exponent and log rules: ommitting

=== Surds ===
Rationalization - making the denominator rational. Consider a surd as a imaginary number. Just multiply by its conjugate.

=== Solving problems ===
* Use contextual relations in addition to universal rules - for solving unknown exponent solutions.
* Use option verification for single variable unknown solutions.

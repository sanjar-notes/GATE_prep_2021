Created Monday 01 February 2021

=== Jargon ===
* Cost Price → The price set by seller.
* Selling price → The price at which the object is finally sold.
* Marked price → Same as CP, except that it is always changeable via discounts. Mostly ~~struck~~ to attract customers.

**Profit/Loss = (SP - CP)/CP * 100**
Positive means profit, negative means loss.

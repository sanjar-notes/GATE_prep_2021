=== Average ===
* Average = (Σf_{i}*a_{i})/Σf_{i}
Set f_{i}=1 if no frequencies are given
Properties of average:
* If each term is manipulated via any of the 4 basic ops, the mean also undergoes the same manipulation.
* minimum ≤ Average ≤ maximum

=== Mixtures ===
Simple mixture - mixing two basic substances
Compound mixture - mixing two or more simple mixtures

**Resultant concentration**
When two liquids of concentration c_{x} and c_{y}, with volumes x and y are mixed, the resultant conc is given by:
	c = total stuff/total solvent
		= (x*c_{x} + y*c_{y})/(x+y)

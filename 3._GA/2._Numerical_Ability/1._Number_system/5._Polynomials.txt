=== Remainder Theorem ===
f(x) % (x-a) = f(a) for some polynomial f(x)
Proof: f(x) = q(x)*(x-a) + r, put x=a â†’ f(a) = r

=== Factor theorem(special case of remainder theorem) ===
If f(a)=0, then (x-a) is a factor of polynomial f(x)

=== For real polynomial eqns ===
* Imaginary roots always come in conjugate pairs
* Wavy curve method for solving
=== For quadratic eqns ===
* Discriminant decides realness of roots
* If ''a'' > 0, then curve is smiling(2nd derivative).
* Extremum: (-b/2a, -D/4a)

* Instantaneous speed(speed) = distance covered in some time/time interval
* Average speed = (total distance)/(total time taken)

=== Average speed ===
* If an object travels with speed v_{1} and v_{2} for equal time in a journey, then v_{avg} = (v_{1}+v_{2})/2
* If an object travels with speed v_{1} and v_{2} for equal distance in a journey, then v_{avg} = 2v_{1}v_{2}/(v_{1}+v_{2})

=== Crossing ===
Object lengths a and b. Speeds v_{a} and v_{b}
* Time if(same direction) = (a+b)/|Î”v|
* Time if(opposite direction) = (a+b)/(v_{a}+v_{b})

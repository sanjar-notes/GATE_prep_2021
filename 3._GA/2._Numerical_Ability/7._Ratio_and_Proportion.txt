====== 7. Ratio and Proportion ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

=== Ratio ===
A unitless fraction
Denominator ↔ Antecedent
Numerator ↔ Consequent

**Basic rule**
If {{./pasted_image.png}} = λ, then:
λ = {{./pasted_image001.png}} = {{./pasted_image002.png}}

**Shortcuts**
* Dimensions and units should be coherent, i.e ratio between rupees and apples is not possible. Cannot do 10cm/1mm without converting both to the same unit.
**Unequal ratios**
* Use inequalities of <, or > 1
=== Proportion ===
a, b, c and d are said to be in "proportion" iff
a/b = c/d

a, d → extremes
b, c → means

=== Properties of ratios ===
1. Inversion is okay - Invertendo
2. Exchanging one value from each side - Alternendo
3. Componendo - Add one on both sides
4. Dividendo - Subtract 1 from both sides
5. Componendo-dividendo: Do componendo and dividendo seperately, then divide the equations.

=== Proportionality ===
Assume a ∝ b^{r}
Directy proportional → r = 1
Inversely proportional → r = -1

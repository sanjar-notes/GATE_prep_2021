====== 5. Time and Work ======
Created Monday 01 February 2021

* Work in Work-Time problems is analogous to distance in distance-time problems.

* Rate of doing word = power = speed
**Get this correct and all problems are solved.**
Pipe and cistern problems are the similar.

=== Assumptions ===
All work is done in a linear fashion.

=== Formulae ===
* A man can do a piece of work in 'a' days â†’ A man can do 1/a work in 1 day
* If A is 'a' times better than B. Then A will take 1/a time to do the same amount of work that B does in 1 day.
* If A can finish the work in x days, and B can do so in y days. Then time taken if they work together is: ''xy/(x+y)''. This is because the total work is the same and total speed is the sum.

* Opposing work, make speed of one negative. In pipes and cisterns the drain is considered negative.
* Efficiency of A w.r.t B = v_{a}/v_{b}

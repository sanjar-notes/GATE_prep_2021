====== 2. Articles ======
Created Tuesday 02 February 2021

An article is a word(actually an adjective) that combines with a noun to indicate the type of reference being made by the noun.

There are two types:
1. Indefinite('**A**' or '**an**') - Does not point out to any definite or particular thing.
Definite('**The**') - Points to some definite or particular person or thing, that is assumed to be known(context).

Use of '**A**':
* Word that starts with a consonant(no vowel) sound.
* Word that starts with sound 'yu' or 'h'.
* Words having a 'wu' sound, however implicit(u in wu may be weak). For example a **on**e-legged dog, where one requires the sound 'wu'.

Use of '**An**':
mAid - All except A
* Word starts with a vowel sound
* Words that have 'h' silent. e.g an heir(prounounced 'eir')

Use of '**The**':
* Used for pointing to things that the receptor is already aware of.

====== 1. Minimum Spanning Tree ======
Created Saturday 13 February 2021

* Spanning Tree - a tree constructed from a graph which covers all vertices.
* MST of a graph is a tree containing all vertices of the graph such sum of the edges is the minimum.

=== Properties of an MST ===
* Many MSTs may exists for a given graph.
* For a spanning tree: |V| - |E| = 1, because it is a tree.
* Adding any edge to an spanning tree creates a cycle.

=== Algorithms for finding MST ===
**Prim's algorithm**
* T = {V_{0}}, any vertex will do.
* Select a neigbour of some vertex in T with minimum weight such that it doesn't make a circuit in T. 
* Add this vertex to T.
* Repeat the procedure until |T| = |V|-1.

T.C - O(V^{2})

**Kruskal's algorithm**
* Let sorted edges be S
* T = {E_{0}}, minimum weight edge. Remove E_{0} from S.
* Select the minimum edge from S. Remove it from E_{0}. If it doesn't make a cycle with the selected graph, add it to T. Else discard it.
* Repeat the procedure until |T| = |V|-1.

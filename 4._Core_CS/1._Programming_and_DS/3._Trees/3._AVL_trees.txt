====== 3. AVL trees ======
Created Thursday 11 February 2021

=== AVL Tree ===
* It is a self balancing tree.
* Height of an AVL tree is θ(log(n)) always.
* There is only one constraint, |h_{left subtree } - h_{right subtree}| ≤	1
* Insertion and deletions are done as per normal BST and balancing is done.
* If it is not met, we do something 'balancing'.

=== Balancing an unbalanced tree ===
* Pivot finding: The node with an unacceptable balance factor which is nearest to the insertion.
* Balancing is done using no more than 3 nodes.
* There are 4 types of imbalanced tree:
	1. Left Left imbalance
	2. Left Right imbalance
	3. Right Left imbalance(mirror of 2)
	4. Right Right imbalance(mirror of 1)
* Important facts about balancing:
	a. One balancing(about the lowermost pivot, nearest to the insertion/deletion site) is enough.
	b. Balancing requires changing the position of at-most 3 nodes.
	c. |Height before balancing - height after balancing| ≤1

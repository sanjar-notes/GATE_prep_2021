====== 1. Binary Trees ======
Created Tuesday 09 February 2021

* A tree where each node has 2 or less children.

=== Types of binary trees ===
1. Strict binary tree - A tree where each node has 0 or 2 children.
2. Skewed binary tree - A tree where N = h, effectively a LL
3. Full binary tree - A BT where each node contains 2 children
4. Complete binary tree - A tree where each inner inner nodes have 2 children each, and this holds from left to right.

=== Representation of BTs ===
1. Array representation - Left(i) = 2*i+1, Right(i)=2*i+2. This is useful only if the tree is a CBT
2. Linked representation - simply in memory.

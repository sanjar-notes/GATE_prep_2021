Created Saturday 13 February 2021

=== Linear data structure ===
* Linear search - search the array one by one. Θ(n) time, Θ(1) time.
* Binary search - works only for sorted arrays. Θ(log(n)) time and Θ(1) time.
=== Non-linear data structure ===
* Binary Trees - Similar to linear search - O(n) time, O(h) memory.
* Binary Search Tree - Θ(h) time, Θ(h) space.

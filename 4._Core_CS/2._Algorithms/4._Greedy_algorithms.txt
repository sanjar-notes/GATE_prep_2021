====== 4. Greedy algorithms ======
Created Saturday 13 February 2021

* We attempt to guess a simple(myopic) rule which may lead to an optimal solution.
* Many problems can be solved using the greedy approach, but not all problems.
* It is generally difficult to prove the correctness of greedy algorithms. This is subjective.
* Greedy solutions are fairly obvious to think of and code.

=== Examples of greedy problems ===
* Prims algorithm
* Kruskal's algorithm
* Knapsack problem

====== 3. Divide and Conquer ======
Created Saturday 13 February 2021

This is a widely used technique for solving problems, it consists of three steps:
1. Breaking the problem into several sub-problems that are similar to the original problem but smaller in size.
2. Solve the sub-problems recursively(successively and independently)
3. Combine the solutions.
=== Examples of divide and conquer ===
* Merge and quick sort
* Binary Tree traversals
* Binary search
* Multiplication of large integers
* Matrix multiplication: Strassen's algorithm
* Closest-pair and convex-hull algorithm
